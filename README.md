# Goals
🌎🌍🌏Saving the environment can be fun, too. Plant trees while being rewarded with engaging experiences! Show off your support with high quality NFTs. 🌳🌲🎋🌴

# Vision in a nutshell: 💲-🔄-🌳🌲🌴😻🖼-🔄-🌎🥰🌍😍🌏
Trade high quality **Nature Guardian** artwork NFTs and save the planet while doing so.

## How do we save the planet? 🌎
Initial purchase of a *savetheplanet* **Nature Guardian** NFT will plant at least XX trees, increased by purchase price.

Significant portion of initial proceeds (at least 50%, growing with stage & automation) will be used to plant trees. Buyer receives tree tokens for each tree.

Significant portion of secondary sales fee (at least 50%, growing with stage & automation) will be used to plant trees. Buyer receives tree tokens for each tree.

## What rewards do we want and how do we make it fun? 🌳🖼🌲😻🌴
1. You help save the planet and get a neat artwork to show it off 🌳😻🌏
2. You receive a beautiful, unique artwork that is yours and yours alone as long as you own the NFT 🖼
3. You receive tree tokens for each project related transaction that you pay for 🌳
4. Tree tokens will receive utility (initial ideas: improve/evolve/transform your Nature Guardian, build your own virtual forest, get access to additional savetheplanet experiences, show off your dedication, make them unique NFTs...) 🌳🌲🌴
5. We have ideas for AR/VR experiences to which your Nature Guardian NFT and/or tree tokens will give you access (initial ideas: visiting a virtual version of the forest you support, showing off your Nature Guarding in AR...) 😻

# Stage 0: Proof of concept (PoC)
## Goal: Proof hypotheses, build community, incentivize MVP stage
**Hypothesis 1** There is interest in the NFT community to continuously contribute to save the planet while buying and trading NFTs.

**Hypothesis 2** High quality artworks incentivize entering the savetheplanet experience.

**Hypothesis 3** We can build a community focused around saving the planet and work together to buildd great value-add experiences.

**Hypothesis 4** Concept works and we plant trees both through initial sales as well as secondary sale fees.

**Hypothesis 5** We learn what features make or break the Minimal Viable Product (MVP).

## Scope
Scope of the PoC will be minimal to verify initial hypotheses before investing time and capital into building a proper MVP. 

## Features 
1. High quality artwork **Nature Guardian** NFTs
2. At least 50% of initial NFT sales price will be converted into trees. At least 10 trees per NFT.
Initial process will be manual and done by aablsk via [The Giving Block](https://thegivingblock.com/) (5% fee) donating to [OneTreePlanted](https://onetreeplanted.org/) (1$/tree).
3. At least 50% of secondary sales fee will be converted into trees.
Initial process will be manual and done by aablsk via [The Giving Block](https://thegivingblock.com/) (5% fee) donating to [OneTreePlanted](https://onetreeplanted.org/) (1$/tree).

## Constraints
1. There will be no tree tokens in PoC stage. Tree tokens will be introduced for MVP stage and tree tokens will be minted retroactively for already planted trees. That also means no utility of tree tokens in PoC stage.
2. No donation receipts.

## Non-functional requirements
1. Use Polygon PoS blockchain.
2. Leverage built-in OpenSea features as much as possible.


# Stage 1: Minimum Viable Product
## Expected core features (subject to change)
1. Planting tree process is completely automated
2. Donation receipts
3. Tree tokens are automatically minted and distributed when planting trees.
4. Additional collection to open up the product to more people.
5. Increase portion of initial sales and secondary fees being tranformed into trees.
